# Pocketvale — Game Design

> This is the full vision. Most of it is **not built yet**. See "Build phases" at the bottom for what exists.

## Pitch

A cozy medieval fantasy idle skilling RPG for phones (portrait). Gather, craft, fight and explore across 11 regions,
with deep progression (every skill to level 500), no energy limits and no paying to skip the grind.

## Core rules

- Single-player for now; player data, market and loot logic are kept separate so multiplayer can be added later.
- All loot goes through one central loot system.
- Gems can ONLY drop from bosses and mini bosses.
- All skills cap at level 500, with a new resource tier every 50 levels.
- No energy limits, no pay-to-skip.
- Cozy medieval style; clean, uncluttered UI.

## Skills

| Skill | Notes |
|---|---|
| Mining | Ores for every tier. |
| Smithing | Ores → bars → weapons, armour and tools. |
| Woodcutting | Logs for every tier. |
| Firemaking | Burn logs (see below). |
| Fishing | Fish for every tier. |
| Cooking | Cook fish into food. |
| Crafting | Tools from wood and stone, with +1 to +10 upgrades. |
| Enhancing | Improve gear. Unlocks the Loot Belt at level 60. |
| Melee, Ranged, Magic | Combat styles. Triangle: Melee beats Ranged, Ranged beats Magic, Magic beats Melee. |
| Defense, Health | Combat survival skills. |

### Levels and XP

- Cap: 500. A new resource tier unlocks every 50 levels.
- XP needed for the next level = `0.5 × level^2.2 + 10 × level` (rounded).
- Better resources give more XP per second, so each new tier feels like a step up.
- Target pace: ~6 hours to level 50, ~35 hours to 100, ~876 hours to 500 for one skill.
- Planning numbers for future gathering tiers (tier t = 0..10): action time ≈ `3 + 0.3t` seconds, XP ≈ `8 × 1.5^t`.

## Ore / metal tiers (11)

| # | Tier | Unlock level |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Bronze (Copper + Tin) | 1 |
| 2 | Iron | 50 |
| 3 | Steel | 100 |
| 4 | Cobalt | 150 |
| 5 | Moonsilver | 200 |
| 6 | Emberite | 250 |
| 7 | Frostcore | 300 |
| 8 | Voidstone | 350 |
| 9 | Starmetal | 400 |
| 10 | Celestium | 450 |
| 11 | Primordial | 500 |

Weapons and armour exist for every tier, each with unique icons.

## Regions (11)

## Firemaking

## Idle system
